What started as a fun game between roommates blossomed into

# ON THE DOT üî¥

Here's how to play ‚Üí

- Guess the item in the top 100 category closest to the 100th spot. (4 total guesses)
- After submitting a guess, you will see its position in the top 100.
- Try to get #100, #99, #98, and #97 for the max score!
- Scores of 90 and above are ON THE DOT 

We have categories such as top athletes, highest grossing movies, most common words, and many more to come! We iteratively improve our game based on user analytics and feedback!
